        <p>
          Strawberry Hedgehog Organics farm & Animal sanctuary is a family run
          business situated near Galway City. It is certified organic by the IOA
          (Irish Organic Association) and a registered animal sanctuary.

          Our aim at Strawberry Hedgehog Organics is to provide nutrient dense,
          fresh organic produce while minimizing the impact of our farm on the
          environment. We do this by growing our produce in an organic and
          sustainable way, regenerating our land and ecosystems in the process
          (leaving the soil and ecosystem in a better state than it was before
          means a lot to us!).
        </p>

          Our animal Sanctuary provides a forever home to animals who were
          rescued from slaughter in the Animal Agriculture industry. We also
          adopt and give lifetime care to companion and domestic animals who
          were homeless, abused or in danger. At The Strawberry Hedgehog Farm we
          provide food, shelter, medical care, and lots of love to over 60
          animals (from 15 species) at our green sanctuary. This part of the
          business runs parallel to all our agri-goods, although all profit
          generated from our petting zoo tours go towards the care, upkeep and
          maintaince of our furry (and feathery.. ) friends.

          We are passionate about what we do, and there isnâ€™t a day where we do
          not learn something new. We also like to share what we know, and
          strive to learn more. With this in mind, we run many different kinds
          of workshops ourslves, as well as guest speakers and lecturers to
          share their wisdom. While these workshops require a fee for the
          public, these are one of the many complimentary benefits available to
          our <a class="link" href="/education.html">volunteers</a> during their
          stay.
